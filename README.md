## About Me
  I'm a beginner Unity Dev. Started programming with Lua in Roblox, then CPP, and now I'm working with C# in Unity.
  
-I'm currently working on completing my first Unity project **JamesBong0070/Crashy-Plane** from start to finish.

-I'm learning how to make Sprites, whipping up stuff of my own creation.

-I plan to implement my own animations later on.

-Just generally having fun creating!
